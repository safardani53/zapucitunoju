Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy were America's golden couple throughout much of the '50s and into the early '60s, ahead of the president's 1963 assassination. For all the glitz and glamour that surrounded them, their marriage was riddled with plenty of hardship, from JFK's alleged and highly publicized affairs to Jackie's difficult pregnancies."><meta name=robots content="index,follow,noarchive"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel=icon href=./favicon.ico><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/sk3/css/sk3.css><style>@media only screen and (min-width:993px){:root{--width-card:32%}}@media only screen and (min-width:993px){:root{--width-html:1200px}}:root{--color-bg:#181a1b}:root{--color-border:white}:root{--color-link:#3d84ff}:root{--color-txt:white}</style><link rel=stylesheet href=./css/abc.css><link rel=stylesheet href=./css/def.css><script>enableOpenToc=!1</script><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/sk3/js/sk3.js></script>

Kennedy</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jackie Kennedy</a> were America's golden couple throughout much of the '50s and into the early '60s, ahead of the president's 1963 assassination. For all the glitz and glamour that surrounded them, their marriage was riddled with plenty of hardship, from JFK's alleged and highly publicized affairs to Jackie's difficult pregnancies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple hit it off after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>being introduced by a mutual friend</a> in 1952. "My brother really was smitten with her right from the very beginning when he first met her at dinner," John's younger brother <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ted Kennedy</a> claimed in Sarah Bradford's 2000 book, America's Queen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackie reportedly had a more realistic view of the situation. "Jackie later says she determined of their relationship, 'Such heartbreak would be worth the pain,' " wrote <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>James Patterson</a> in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The House of Kennedy</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They would still go on to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wed in 1953</a>, with four children in total being born to the couple, though only two — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Caroline Kennedy</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>John F. Kennedy Jr.</a> — ever left the hospital. Tragically, in 1956 Jackie gave birth to their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>stillborn daughter</a>, Arabella, and the couple's fourth child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>died just 39 hours</a> after birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their fertility struggles, the Kennedy's relationship was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marred by infidelity</a>. By most accounts, Jackie was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>well aware of her husband's alleged indiscretions</a>. "It was a marriage of its time," a close family friend told PEOPLE. "It was kinetic between them. She wasn't trying to change him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others, however, say that John's assumed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cheating was a source of contention</a> for the couple. "There were many senators and people who worked for the president who were really well aware of the conversations that Jackie had with JFK, in which she made it really clear that she knew what was going on," Jackie, Janet and Lee author J. Randy Taraborrelli told PEOPLE. "She wasn't naive to it. They did have many conversations about it, and she did tell him that she was sick of it and she didn't like it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As one of the couple's friends told PEOPLE, "At the end of the day, Jack came back to Jackie — and that was it. They loved each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proof of Jackie's love and care for John, in the form of hand-written letters and meal plans, went <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>up for auction</a> in July 2023. The letters included intricate instructions for her and the then-Senator's meals, including a note that instructs that John "can eat nothing fried."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at John F.
